1.	What is CV?
Understanding the real world with the help of computer and try to mimic how human visualize and understand the real world. 
As human vision can do some amazing thing like Recognize people and objects, Navigate through obstacles, Understand the mood in the scene and imagine stories and the same work CV can do like intelligent interpretation of pictures and scenes, Understandings the input image and scene, Extracting the valuable information from the scene or pictures and description of the scene information etc.

2.	What are the various components of the CV system?
Components of CV system includes light, scene, camera, computer vision algorithm and computer for scene interpretation and visualization.

3.	What are the various application domain of CV?
Character recognition, Documents processing, Biometric Analysis, Forensic Analysis, Pose and Gesture identification, Automatic inspection of industrial products, Industrial process monitoring, Biomedical Engineering, Military surveillance and target identification, Navigation and Mobility and Remote Sensing using satellite imagery etc.

4.	What are the CV tasks?
Image representation, Image description, Feature Extraction, Image matching, Stereo image processing, range data processing and image segmentation.

5.	What are the difference between computer vision and image processing?
In CV input is image or scenes and output is smart interpretation of pictures or scenes and output may be represented in the form of scalar, vector or matrix. But in the case of image processing input is image and out is also image but transformed version.
